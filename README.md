# OptiTrack Motion Capture Setup Guide with VRPN and TurtleBot3 on ROS Melodic and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

## Prerequisites
- ROS Melodic is already installed on your WSL machine.
- OptiTrack Motive is installed and running on your Windows machine.

## Steps to Configure and Connect VRPN to ROS

### 1. Install the vrpn_client_ros Package

Install the VRPN Client ROS Package:  
Open a terminal in WSL and run:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-vrpn-client-ros
```

### 2. Configure Motive (on Windows)

Enable VRPN Streaming:
- Open OptiTrack Motive on your Windows machine.
- Go to Data Streaming Settings and enable VRPN.
- Copy the port number (default is 3883) from Motive for later use in the ROS launch file.

Check Firewall Settings:
- Allow traffic on the VRPN port in your Windows firewall.
- Go to Windows Firewall with Advanced Security > Inbound Rules, and create a new rule allowing UDP traffic on the VRPN port.

### 3. Configure ROS Launch File

Copy the Sample Launch File:  
Instead of creating a launch file from scratch, copy the sample launch file provided by the vrpn_client_ros package:

```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src/mocap_vrpn/launch
cp /opt/ros/melodic/share/vrpn_client_ros/launch/sample.launch ~/catkin_ws/src/mocap_vrpn/launch/mocap_vrpn.launch
```

Edit the Launch File:  
Open the copied launch file and adjust the server argument to point to your Windows IP address (instead of 127.0.0.1):

```
nano ~/catkin_ws/src/mocap_vrpn/launch/mocap_vrpn.launch
```

Modify the following line:

```
<arg name="server" default="127.0.0.1"/>
```

Change it to your Windows IP address:

```
<arg name="server" default="Your_Windows_IP"/>
```

For example, if your Windows IP is 10.8.2.136:

```
<arg name="server" default="10.8.2.136"/>
```

Edit Trackers:  
Ensure the trackers section matches your rigid body name(s) in Motive:

```
trackers:
  - TestBody  # Name of the rigid body from Motive
```

Build and Source the Workspace:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

### 4. Important Note for WSL Users

When using WSL, do not use 127.0.0.1 for the VRPN server address. The IP 127.0.0.1 refers to the WSL environment and not your Windows machine. Instead, use the IP address of your Windows machine (e.g., 10.8.2.136), which you can find by running ipconfig in a Windows command prompt.

### 5. Test the Setup

Start Motive on your Windows machine and ensure the VRPN server is running.

Launch the VRPN client node in ROS:

```
roslaunch mocap_vrpn mocap_vrpn.launch
```

Verify ROS Topics:  
Check for the available topics using:

```
rostopic list
```

You should see a topic like /vrpn/TestBody/pose.

Inspect the Pose Data:  
You can inspect the pose data of your tracked body in ROS:

```
rostopic echo /vrpn/TestBody/pose
```

Visualize the Pose Data in RViz:  
Open RViz by running:

```
rviz
```

In RViz, follow these steps:
- Click the "Add" button in the lower-left corner.
- Select "By Topic" from the list.
- Expand the /vrpn topic and select the "Pose" option under your tracked object (e.g., /vrpn/TestBody/pose).
- RViz will now display the tracked pose of the object in real-time.

Adjust Visualization (Optional):
- You can customize the display by adjusting the pose markers (e.g., setting up arrows, axes, or shapes).
- Ensure that you have the TF (transform frames) visualization active if needed, to help understand the frame transformations.

### 6. Optional: Install VRPN for Testing (Optional)

If you want to test VRPN connections outside of ROS, you can install VRPN from source to use tools like vrpn_print_devices to check if the connection to the VRPN server is working. This step is optional and not required for normal ROS operations.

Steps for Installing VRPN for Testing:

Install Dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

Clone and Build VRPN:

```
git clone https://github.com/vrpn/vrpn.git
cd vrpn
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Test with VRPN Tools:  
After building, you can use the following tools to test the connection:
- vrpn_print_devices <Your_Windows_IP> 3883
- vrpn_print_messages <Your_Windows_IP> 3883

These tools allow you to verify if the VRPN server is correctly streaming data.

## Troubleshooting

- Connection Issues: Ensure that Motive and ROS can communicate over the same network. Use the correct IP address of the Windows machine in the ROS configuration.
- Firewall: Double-check firewall rules to ensure no traffic is blocked between WSL and Windows.
- Network Configuration: If using WSL, ensure you're using the Windows IP (10.8.x.x) and not 127.0.0.1 for the VRPN server.

With these steps, your setup should be successfully streaming OptiTrack motion capture data into ROS.
